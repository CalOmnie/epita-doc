# Linux netboot

Archlinux is the operating system chosen by the school. It is directly available from the network boot (see [IT Workstation](pie.md))

## Live session

The archlinux image evolves through the year to allow students to realize projects.

The image is loaded in the memory. Which means that the entirety of the modifications made ouside the AFS folders are lost on reboot.

## Epita account

An epita account, without any password, is available at any moment. It allows one to quickly log in on a computer, even without network (if it is already started, obviously). It is strongly recommended to turn off the computer after using this account to avoid people from retrieving datas by reloging on it.

## Student session

Each student has a session on the network. To lon on it, one has to use he's login and his "epita" [password](passwords.md).

Personnal folders are stocked on [AFS](afs.md). It is essential to read this topic.
